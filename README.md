DEVELOPMENT OF A BOOK CLUB MOBILE APPLICATION USING FLUTTER
 A Book Club is a social gathering where  many people or a group of people meet to discuss A 
Book or Books that they have read and express their 
opinions, likes and dislikes. The Flutter Application 
that we are developing is based on such social 
gatherings. The Application aims at allowing the 
customers to form groups to discuss the books that 
they prefer, create a group or join in to an existing 
group, to add a new book to the group, facility to set 
a timer for the next book to be revealed, add reviews 
for the books that they have read, pick a new book, 
check notifications and check the book club history. 
The Application aims at managing the state of the 
group effectively and error free. The Application 
gives the opportunity to the customer to add a new 
book to the group. We are using the application 
development software flutter to create and develop 
our mobile application. We aim to represent how 
flutters works when compared to other traditional 
application development platforms. Another 
objective of our application is to represent the 
benefits of using flutter ,to make an observation of 
how it can be used, compare with other already 
frequently used application development platforms 
and determine whether flutter meets all 
expectations. The main objective of the project is to 
Develop an application on the topic of “ 
Development of a book club application using 
flutter” and use it to research the new trend that is 
flutter
